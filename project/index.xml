      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;m working on With baseball season fast approaching, I am currently working on a linear regression that uses season statistics to predict MVP vote shares for each player. Using the invaluable Lahman database, through the Lahman R package, I intend to build what will hopefully be a decent prediction model, and then use that model to track the state of the MVP race in each baseball league (AL and NL) as the season progresses.</description>
