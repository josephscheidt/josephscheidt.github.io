      <description>Number Shuffle Fivethirtyeight.com posted a problem in their weekly Riddler article on Friday which I found particularly interesting. It is as follows:
Imagine taking a number and moving its last digit to the front. For example, 1,234 would become 4,123. What is the smallest positive integer such that when you do this, the result is exactly double the original number? (For bonus points, solve this one without a computer.)
After some thought, I was able to reason out how to get to the answer.</description>

      <description>Welcome Thanks for visiting! I am very happy to start sharing some of my work in a place where someone besides me can actually see and read about it.
 How I Built This Site Big thanks to the brilliant tutorial written by Emily Zabor.
This site was built using blogdown, and if you are attempting to build a blogdown site you should definitely check out this amazing book.
I am currently using the Ghostwriter Hugo theme, hosted here.</description>
